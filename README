PROQ SCRIPTS
Contact: bjornw@ifm.liu.se

ProQ_scripts contain the scripts and programs needed to generate the
sequence specific input features to the ProQ and ProQM scoring
functions in Rosetta.

INSTALLATION
To install the program you need to do the following steps (the order does not matter)
1) Set the $DB variable in bin/run_all_external.pl to a dbformated sequence database e.g. uniref90.
2) run ./configure.pl

TEST
To check that everythin is set up
run ./run_test.sh
This should create all the files needed with any error messages...:-) 


RUNNING 
Once set up the main program 'bin/run_all_external.pl' will run
everything using either a fastafile or extracting the sequence from a
pdb

bash$ bin/run_all_external.pl
Usage: run_all_external.pl -pdb [pdbfile] -fasta [fastafile] -membrane 1 (if membrane protein) -overwrite 1 (if overwrite)

For water solulable proteins run:
bin/run_all_external.pl -pdb <pdbfile>
or
bin/run_all_external.pl -fasta <fastafile>

For membrane proteins run:
bin/run_all_external.pl -pdb <pdbfile> -membrane 1
or
bin/run_all_external.pl -fasta <fastafile> -membrane 1

To use the sequence specific files in rosetta you need to use
-ProQ:basename <basename>, where <basename> is the location of either
the input pdbfile or input fastafile used to generate the sequence
specific features. All features have the following naming: basename.*,
e.g. basename.ss2 for secondary structure prediction or basename.mtx
for psiblast profile etc.

Currently there are no functionality to account for models that are
missing residues. These have to be handled outside by for instance
creating the features for the full length sequence and pick out the
features for the residues that do exist.
