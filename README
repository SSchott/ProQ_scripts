PROQ SCRIPTS
Contact: bjornw@ifm.liu.se
git: https://github.com/bjornwallner/ProQ_scripts.git

ProQ_scripts contain the scripts and programs needed to generate the
sequence specific input features to the ProQ and ProQM scoring
functions in Rosetta.

If you already have a version of Rosetta 3.5 follow the instructions below, 
otherwise use the download the lastest weekly release.

Alt 1) 
PATCH ROSETTA 3.5 to include ProQ and ProQM scoring functions
1) Download rosetta 3.5, from https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/
   i.e rosetta3.5_source.tar and rosetta3.5_database.tar
2) mkdir rosetta3.5
3) cp rosetta3.5_source.tar and rosetta3.5_database.tar rosetta3.5/
4) tar -xvf rosetta3.5_source.tar
5) tar -xvf rosetta3.5_database.tar
6) patch -p0 < ../ProQ_scripts/ProQ2_patch_rosetta3.5_with_test ,
where ../ProQ_scripts/ProQ2_patch_rosetta3.5_with_test should be replaced with the actual location of the patch file.
7) compile rosetta according to the instructions.

Alt 2)
1) Download the latest weekly release (after week 36, 2013)
from https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/, you need a license but it's free for academia.
2) compile rosetta according to the instructions.


INSTALLATION
To install the programs you need to do the following steps (the order does not matter)
1) Set the $DB variable in bin/run_all_external.pl to a dbformated sequence database e.g. uniref90.
2) run ./configure.pl

TEST
To check that everything is set up
run ./run_test.sh
This should create all the files needed with any error messages...:-) 


RUNNING 
Once set up the main program 'bin/run_all_external.pl' will run
everything using either a fastafile or extracting the sequence from a
pdb

bash$ bin/run_all_external.pl
Usage: run_all_external.pl -pdb [pdbfile] -fasta [fastafile] -membrane 1 (if membrane protein) -overwrite 1 (if overwrite)

For water solulable proteins run:
bin/run_all_external.pl -pdb <pdbfile>
or
bin/run_all_external.pl -fasta <fastafile>

For membrane proteins run:
bin/run_all_external.pl -pdb <pdbfile> -membrane 1
or
bin/run_all_external.pl -fasta <fastafile> -membrane 1

To use the sequence specific files in rosetta you need to use
-ProQ:basename <basename>, where <basename> is either
the input pdbfile or input fastafile used to generate the sequence
specific features. All features have the following naming: basename.*,
e.g. basename.ss2 for secondary structure prediction or basename.mtx
for psiblast profile etc.

Currently there are no functionality to account for models that have
missing residues. These have to be handled outside by for instance
creating the features for the full length sequence and pick out the
features for the residues that do exist.


RUNNING ProQ or ProQM on 1abc.pdb

1) Create the sequence specific features as described above. You do this once for a given sequence.
   i.e. bin/run_all_external.pl -pdb 1abc.pdb, will create files with the basename 1abc.pdb
   For membrane proteins
   bin/run_all_external.pl -pdb 1abc.pdb -membrane 1

2) to score all *.pdb run:
   score.linuxgccrelease -database <rosetta database> -in:file:fullatom -ProQ:basename 1abc.pdb -in:file:s *.pdb -out:file:scorefile ProQ.sc -score:weights ProQ -out:file:scorefile
For membrane protein:
   score.linuxgccrelease -database <rosetta database> -in:file:fullatom -ProQ:basename 1abc.pdb -in:file:s *.pdb -out:file:scorefile ProQM.sc score:weights ProQM -ProQ:membrane 

This will produce a scorefiles with with the a global score corresponding to summed local scores. To get the usual ProQ/ProQM score divide by length or run the scoring with -ProQ:normalize <target length> to get normalized scores directly.

To get the local scores run the scoring with -ProQ:output_local_prediction, this will generate a local quality estimates with the name ProQM.<pdb>
